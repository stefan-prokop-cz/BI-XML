               			Indonesia has a stated foreign policy objective of establishing stable fixed land
               and maritime boundaries with all of its neighbors; three stretches of land borders
               with Timor-Leste have yet to be delimited, two of which are in the Oecussi exclave
               area, and no maritime or Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) boundaries have been established
               between the countries; many refugees from Timor-Leste who left in 2003 still reside
               in Indonesia and refuse repatriation; all borders between Indonesia and Australia
               have been agreed upon bilaterally, but a 1997 treaty that would settle the last of
               their maritime and EEZ boundary has yet to be ratified by Indonesia's legislature;
               Indonesian groups challenge Australia's claim to Ashmore Reef; Australia has closed
               parts of the Ashmore and Cartier Reserve to Indonesian traditional fishing and placed
               restrictions on certain catches; land and maritime negotiations with Malaysia are
               ongoing, and disputed areas include the controversial Tanjung Datu and Camar Wulan
               border area in Borneo and the maritime boundary in the Ambalat oil block in the Celebes
               Sea; Indonesia and Singapore continue to work on finalizing their 1973 maritime boundary
               agreement by defining unresolved areas north of Indonesia's Batam Island; Indonesian
               secessionists, squatters, and illegal migrants create repatriation problems for Papua
               New Guinea; maritime delimitation talks continue with Palau; EEZ negotiations with
               Vietnam are ongoing, and the two countries in Fall 2011 agreed to work together to
               reduce illegal fishing along their maritime boundary
