               <h3>Current Situation</h3>
               				Mauritius is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children
               subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking; Mauritian girls are induced or sold
               into prostitution, often by peers, family members, or businessmen offering other forms
               of employment; Mauritian adults have been identified as labor trafficking victims
               in the UK, Belgium, and Canada, while Mauritian women from Rodrigues Island are also
               subject to domestic servitude in Mauritius; Malagasy women transit Mauritius en route
               to the Middle East for jobs as domestic servants and subsequently are subjected to
               forced labor; Cambodian men are victims of forced labor on foreign fishing vessels
               in Mauritius’ territorial waters; other migrant workers from East and South Asia and
               Madagascar are also subject to forced labor in Mauritius’ manufacturing and construction
               sectors
               			
               <h3>Tier Rating</h3>
               				Tier 2 Watch List – Mauritius does not fully comply with the minimum standards
               for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do
               so; in 2014, the government made modest efforts to address child sex trafficking but
               none related to adult forced labor; law enforcement lacks an understanding of trafficking
               crimes outside of child sex trafficking, despite increasing evidence of other forms
               of human trafficking; authorities made no trafficking prosecutions or convictions
               and made modest efforts to assist a couple of child sex trafficking victims; officials
               sustained an extensive public awareness campaign to prevent child sex trafficking,
               but no efforts were made to raise awareness or reduce demand for forced adult or child
               labor
